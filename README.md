# Positioning Others & Devices
Positioning Others & Devices (POD) is a tool designed to visualize an individuals relationships to people in their life as well as frequently used technical devices in a mutual context. The creation of this web-app was part of my bachelor thesis and is based on an early version described in [this paper by Dr. Astrid Carolus et. al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444818817074). Used in conjunction with questionaires and interviews it is supposed to provide another way of measuring how a device integrates itself into a users life. From these informations we can draw conclusions about and implications for its UX-Design.
